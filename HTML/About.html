<h1>About us</h1>
<p>
The foundation is an NGO registered in Kenya. It is headquatered in Kisumu-Kenya. The main goal is to demonstrate that by supporting communities it is possible to live in Africa and earn the same living standards most migrate to achieve. The awakening is achieved by economically empowering local communities without patronizing them. Priority is given to use of indigenous ideas, local talent, utilizing of natural resources and less reliance on foreign donations. This contrasts with previous approaches that have prescribed solutions to people witnessing the problems. The community is reminded that resources used  to develop the first countries were taken from Africa.  It is believed that this approach will gain Africans respect abroad. The economic partnership will rival that of NAFTA and EU. It will allow African countries to trade amongst themselves and reduce the potential of economic blackmail using economic aid. It will also increase confidence of ideas of Africans and on their abilities. Empowering communities is a win for both the borrowers and the lenders as loans are repaid and lenders. Lenders donâ€™t have to forgive loans which is a loss to them while borrowing countries are not only able to repay their loans but are able to gain respect.</p>
